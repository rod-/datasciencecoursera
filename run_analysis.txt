#these comments are intended to describe roughly what happened in the course of creating run_analysis.R.  The comments in the rscript themselves
#probably do a better job.  But i have to have a "codebook"
#merge training set with test set to create a single dataset
#extract mean and SD for each measurement (note that this only removes data, it does not add or manipulate anything)
#Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
#From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
#Please upload the tidy data set created in step 5 of the instructions. Please upload your data set as a txt file created with write.table() using row.name=FALSE
#also included:  The actual readme file from the original dataset:

Note that this independent tidy data set is produced in two ways via run_analysis.R -  The r data frame "result" and the text file "JPUPCCP.txt"
The script also assumes that you have packages installed, they are loaded via the script but it is assumed they are pre-installed:  reshape2 and dplyr
The result dataframe shows the mean of each variable for each activity for each subject.  There are 180 subject/activity pairs, and 79 measured mean/std variables.
Note that this 79 figure is not 66 like some have discussed for this dataset - frequency is also a measurement, and those 13 meanfrequencies are included.

Below is the original documentation for variables and their meanings.

Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
