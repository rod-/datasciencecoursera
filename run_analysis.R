#merge training set with test set to create a single dataset
#extract mean and SD for each measurement
#Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
#From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
#Please upload the tidy data set created in step 5 of the instructions. Please upload your data set as a txt file created with write.table() using row.name=FALSE
